# Clappr Thumbnails Plugin
A plugin for clappr which will display thumbnails when hovering over the scrub bar. Thumbnails can either be individual images or a sprite sheet. You can find a tool which will generate a sprite sheet from a video [here](https://github.com/flavioribeiro/video-thumbnail-generator).

# Usage
Add both Clappr and the thumbnails plugin scripts to your HTML:

```html
<head>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.clappr.io/latest/clappr.min.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="dist/clappr-thumbnails-plugin.js"></script>
</head>
```

You can also find the project on npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/clappr-thumbnails-plugin

Then just add `ClapprThumbnailsPlugin` into the list of plugins of your player instance, and the options for the plugin go in the `scrubThumbnails` property as shown below.

```javascript
var player = new Clappr.Player({
  source: "http://your.video/here.mp4",
  plugins: {
    core: [ClapprThumbnailsPlugin]
  },
  scrubThumbnails: {
    backdropHeight: 64,
    spotlightHeight: 84,
    thumbs: [
    	{time: 0, url: "assets/thumbs/thumb_1.jpg"},
    	{time: 2, url: "assets/thumbs/thumb_2.jpg"},
    	{time: 4, url: "assets/thumbs/thumb_3.jpg"}
    ]
  }
});
```

`backdropHeight` and `spotlightHeight` are the heights that the thumbnails will be scaled to for the backdrop and spotlight respectively. Either of these can be `0` or `null` to disable them. The `thumbs` property is an array of all the thumbnails. The `time` property is the time in seconds that maps to the thumbnail image located at `url`.

If you are using a sprite sheet you can use the helper method `ClapprThumbnailsPlugin.buildSpriteConfig(spriteSheetUrl, numThumbs, thumbWidth, thumbHeight, numColumns, timeInterval)` which will generate the object for the `thumbs` property for you.

# Adding and Removing Thumbnails Dynamically
You can add/remove thumbnails at any time using the `addThumbnail()` and `removeThumbnail()` methods as shown below. Both these methods will also take an array.

```javascript
var thumbnailsPlugin = player.getPlugin("scrub-thumbnails");
var newThumb = {
  url: "http://tjenkinson.me/clappr-thumbnails-plugin/assets/thumbnails/thumb_10.jpg",
  time: 12.5
};

thumbnailsPlugin.addThumbnail(newThumb).then(function() {
  console.log("Thumbnail added.");
}).then(function() {
  thumbnailsPlugin.removeThumbnail(newThumb).then(function(success) {
    console.log("Thumbnail removed.");
  });
});
```
